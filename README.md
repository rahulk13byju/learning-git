# My first github repo

This is just a github repo I am playing around with, to learn git and github.

Here's a sample python script:
```python
import os
print ('hello, world')
```

And, here's some solidity code.
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

contract Mycontract {
  string greet = "Hello";
}
```
